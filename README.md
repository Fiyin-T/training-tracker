# Team Trainings

## Team Trainings App

The team trainings tracker application can be used to track the training activities of a football team. New players/team members and their profile details (Name, height, position...) can be added to the tracker on the add player page. Once they are added they become part of the team list where individual profiles can be selected and viewed.

Each team member profile contains information about the player and details as well as their previous training history. New training activities and the duration it took can be added to a player's profile to track their progress in improving any specified attribute to better their game.

A team member's information from their profile page can also be updated if there is a change in height or position of the team member as time progresses.
